# Ursus API

An Urbit API/`%gall` agent client for iOS/macOS in Swift.

See my [Ursus Chat](https://github.com/dclelland/UrsusChat) repository for a demo project.

## Installation

Ursus can be installed using Cocoapods by adding the following line to your podfile:

```ruby
pod 'UrsusAPI', '~> 0.1'
```

I can probably help set up Carthage or Swift Package Manager support if you need it.

## Dependencies
